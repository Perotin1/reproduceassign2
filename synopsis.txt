Decision was taken to categorise values whether or not damage thresholds were not.
This will not distort considerations of total damage done, and while
it does impact summary statistics for extreme weather events, but considering that
events will continue to occur without causing damage, this data was considered relevant.

Per mentor Usama Khalil, prior to Jan 1996, not all event types were recorded.
We exclude these years as this would otherwise radically distort harm metrics in favour of the longer 
historied event types







To optimise cleaning:
Functionalise Partial Matching to EVTYPES
Remove elements with acceptable EVTYPES initially and after each loop to accelerate looping.

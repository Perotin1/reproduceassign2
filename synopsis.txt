Decision was taken to categorise values whether or not damage thresholds were not.
This will not distort considerations of total damage done, and while
it does impact summary statistics for extreme weather events, but considering that
events will continue to occur without causing damage, this data was considered relevant.

Plan:
create dataset without already correct values then operate on
then merge back into original dataset

want to get most combinations of evtypes
